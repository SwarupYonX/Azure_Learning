Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) are the fundamental building block of your private network in Azure. VNets enable you to build complex virtual networks that are similar to an on-premises network, with additional benefits of Azure infrastructure such as scale, availability, and isolation.

Capabilities of Azure Virtual Networks:
Azure VNets enable resources in Azure to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.

    Communication with the internet: All resources in a VNet can communicate outbound to the internet, by default. You can communicate inbound to a resource by assigning a public IP address or a public Load Balancer. You can also use public IP or public Load Balancer to manage your outbound connections.
    Communication between Azure resources: There are three key mechanisms through which Azure resource can communicate: VNets, VNet service endpoints and VNet peering. You can use service endpoints to connect to other Azure resource types, such as Azure SQL databases and storage accounts.
