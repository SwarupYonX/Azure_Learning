Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS):
    Is a azure service that allows to deploy compute capacity with dynamic scalabity and high availability.

    VMSS provides a scalable way to run applications on a set of VMs. When deployed, the VMs in the scale set can all have the same configuration and run the same applications or have different configuration and run different applications.
        - As demand grows, the number of VMs running in the sacle set increases.
        - As demand goes down, the number of VMs running in the scale set decreases.

    VMSS are ideal for scenarios that include compute work-load, big-data workloads, and container workloads.
    VMSS are intelligent enough to automatically scale up and down the number of VM instances.
    A scale set uses a load balancer to distribute requests across the VM instances. It uses a health probe or the Application Health Extension to determine the availablity of each instance.
        - If the instance respond, the scale set knows the instance is still available.
        - If the instance fails to respond, the scale set knows the instance is unavailable and doesn't send requests to it.
    
    Virtual Machine Scale Sets support both Linux and Windows VMs in Azure. If you deal with large workloads with varying and unpredictable demands, scale sets are a great solution because they automatically provide a highly available and scalable environment.
